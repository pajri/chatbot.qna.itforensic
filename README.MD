## About ChatBot
The chatbot is designed to provide a Q&A experience focused on IT Forensics. It strictly refers to the content of the article provided in the data folder. If a question cannot be answered based on the provided article, the chatbot will tell that it does not have the answer even though it may have its own general knowledge about IT Forensics.

Currently, the chatbot uses "Definition and Basic Concepts (en)" from Sir Onnoâ€™s Wiki (https://onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/Definition_and_Basic_Concepts_(en)) as its reference. This means it will only answer questions related to the basic definitions and concepts of IT Forensics. It will not answer questions about advanced techniques or in-depth forensic practices.

The chatbot is currently limited to a single article for faster testing and development. But it can be expanded its knowledge base by adding more articles to the data folder.
